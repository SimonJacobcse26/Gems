# Video Recommendation Web Application

This project is a responsive single-page application designed to display video recommendations based on predefined categories. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.

2. **Video Recommendations**: Displays video recommendations based on categories such as "All," "Gaming," "Music," and "Tech."

3. **Category Selection**: Users can select a specific category ("All," "Gaming," "Music," or "Tech") to view videos related to that category only.

4. **Search Functionality**: Includes a search bar that allows users to filter videos based on their titles.

5. **Loader Feature**: Implements a loader to indicate ongoing data retrieval or processing until all necessary information is displayed.
